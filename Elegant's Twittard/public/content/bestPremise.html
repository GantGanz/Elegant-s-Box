            <h1>Talentless Nana | The Best Premise from All Form of Entertainment</h1>
            <hr>
        </div>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Ahh, anime.. for some people, this word is a big turn off, and for the rest its a big <element
                class="popup-meme" onclick="togglePopupMeme(`yeah-boy.gif`)">turn on</element>. Either you
            love it or you hate it, or both at the same time. But today I'm not gonna talk about that, but rather, I'm
            going to talk about the best premise I've ever seen which is coincidentally happening in this anime.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            The name is Talentless Nana or Munou na Nana in Japanese. This is a new anime that coming out this season
            (fall 2020). So, what makes this anime have the best premise of all other things in the world? Now, before
            jumping into that, let's see whats the original source describe this anime :
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            "It is the year 20XX. Earth was assaulted by monsters that would come to be known as "the Enemy of
            Humanity." In order to deal with this threat, special schools composed of teenagers with extraordinary
            abilities were formed. These people, who came to be known as "the Talented," had abilities that could defy
            the rules of reality.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Among these people with supernatural powers was an outlier, an individual who was sent to one of these
            schools despite having no innate special abilities whatsoever. This is the story of our protagonist, who
            attempts to defeat the Enemies of Humanity through the use of intelligence and manipulation alone."
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            (Source: MU).
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            While it sounds pretty solid, but it just likes every other generic anime right? well yes, it is. But
            actually, it has so much more, the synopsis purposely make it look that way to surprise the audience. So,
            before I proceed any further, I'm just gonna put <span class="font-weight-bold">*SPOILER ALERT*</span> here,
            at least go watch the <element class="popup-meme"
                onclick="togglePopupMessage(`(just bear with the generic-est plot until the end)`)">first episode
            </element> so u don't get a major spoiler.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            After a painful cliche story about weak-silent-bullied boi who suddenly getting approached by a cute girl
            and in the end showing op hidden power <element class="popup-meme"
                onclick="togglePopupMeme(`roll-eyes-tony.gif`)">(classic anime type of sh*t)</element>, by the end,
            you'll come to a realization that it's not the story about that boy named Nana(o), but rather about that
            cute girl named Nana.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Now, I assume that u already watch the first episode, and roughly know what my point is. But if u don't, or
            just completely missed my point, here's the full premise according to my point of view :
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Just imagine, there's 1 <element class="popup-meme"
                onclick="togglePopupMessage(`(I always say cute, but what I intended to say is that she looks reasonably weak)`)">
                cute</element> talentless girl dropped in an island full of talent full people (superhero kind of
            power), and their talent isn't like sh*tty (*weak) talent in My Hero Academia (Boku No Hero Academia, BNHA),
            where in the entire UE Academy, there're less than 10 people who really make today's people cant <element
                class="popup-meme"
                onclick="togglePopupMessage(`(U know like almost everyone is supposedly powerless again a mere gun lol)`)">
                handle it</element>.
            And her mission is to kill the entire student on that island, s i n g l e h a n d l e d l y, without even
            knowing their power first. That's it.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            So basically in order to do that, she needs to use her brain to kill em, like using other's people power to
            her benefit, use or crafting basic human weapon (like poison, trap, etc), and mostly, use her psychological
            knowledge to get an upper hand, avoid any danger, and get suspected (she said she has mind-reading power,
            but in fact, she's using sherlock holmes's deductive things)
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Wait, I'm always mocking the BNHA, but what exactly their powers r? this :
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Iceman, fireman (classic)</li>
            <li>Teleporter (hmmm tricky)</li>
            <li>Time traveler, future seeing (the f*ck, how to even kill em? or rather, how to not
                even get caught by them?)</li>
            <li>Necromancer who can control the other's ability that she resurrected and have their memory intact too
                (lmao so troublesome for silent assassinator or in all-out battle)</li>
            <li>Freaking immortal guy <element class="popup-meme" onclick="togglePopupMeme(`what-tom.gif`)">(huh what?)
                </element>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-justify">
            That's it, can u imagine the impossibilities? how can she even have a chance to win singlehandedly battling
            against all those <element class="popup-meme"
                onclick="togglePopupMessage(`(referencing X-Man from Marvel)`)">
                omega level mutants</element> (at this point it's not so exaggerating to even call em gods lol)
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            So <element class="popup-meme" onclick="togglePopupMeme(`in-conclusion.png`)">
                in conclusion</element>, I just love witnessing underdog characters beating the odds without deus ex
            machina or some cliche anime sh*t like the power of friendships, pure heart, courage, vigor, etc. but
            rather, just using the most powerful part of the human body, <element class="popup-meme"
                onclick="togglePopupMeme(`big-brain.jpg`)"> The Brain</element>.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            That's about it, I think its already too long, I'll give you an update on whether it can keep up with the
            great premise, or just fail miserably. <element class="popup-meme" onclick="togglePopupMeme(`bye-tom.gif`)">
                See you in the next post</element>.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Oh, and if u wanna watch it l e g g a l l y, u can visit Muse Asia (with English subtitle) or Muse Indonesia
            (for Indonesian subtitle) on Youtube. It's a great channel, free and very accessible, so why are u still
            visit an illegal website? <element class="popup-meme" onclick="togglePopupMeme(`pirate.gif`)">
