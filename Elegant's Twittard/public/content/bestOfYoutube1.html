            Okay, so today I'm gonna talk about the best standalone videos on Youtube. Please keep in mind that it's
            impossible to write them all in a 'single sheet', so I choose to include the one which crosses my mind by
            the time I write this, and it's limited only to videos that I've seen. So if something is bothering u or u
            have better suggestions, just tell me in the comments section below. So here we go:

            Best short story video, if not the best video on youtube so far lol. At first, I thought it's gonna be about
            a dragon that kidnaped a princess and how the knight is able to save her or some sort. But no, the story
            goes with a very very unexpected turn, in a freaking good way. I'm not gonna spoil it nor interpreted
            anything, it's just too vast and complex to explain it in a short text. Go try to watch it, and I promise u,
            u gonna love every second of it. The narration and music are spots on, the atmospheric sounds blend very
            well with the intonation and pacing of the story. The illustration and animation are brilliant, proven by
            their choice of <element class="popup-meme"
                onclick="togglePopupMessage(`(that campfire to candle to neon light scene tho)`)">
                objects that accompany the narration</element>, or
            the subtle animation that fits in with the <element class="popup-meme"
                onclick="togglePopupMessage(`(like a father's face that becomes red gradually)`)">
                illustration's tone</element>. But what the best about this video, is no other than the story itself,
            the pacing is superb. Although it's an adaptation of
            <a href="https://www.singularityweblog.com/the-fable-of-the-dragon-tyrant-by-nick-bostrom/#:~:text=The%20Fable%20of%20the%20Dragon%2DTyrant%20is%20a%2010%20minute,thousands%20of%20people%20every%20day."
                target="_blank">another short story</a>, the minor or
            major change here and there makes it almost like they are two different
            stories with a different message and moral lesson, but both are great in their own way, which version is the
            best? u decided on it. Yeah, some things are not adapted perfectly which makes it <element
                class="popup-meme"
                onclick="togglePopupMessage(`(like, 10k people every day in a seemingly rather small kingdom? C'mon)`)">
                less logical</element>, but all of em is just minor things, nothings
            change much.

            This is the best painting explanation video I've ever seen. It shows why this painting is great without
            making us feel like it's being too over-analyzed like any other painting explanation video does. Everything
            he said sounds perfectly make sense and he made it easier to digest without using too many complicated
            technical terms or vague examples that barely can be seen. And lastly, the painting itself is mind-blowing,
            literally, <element class="popup-meme" onclick="togglePopupMeme(`mind-blowing.gif`)">
                explode</element>. Unlike The Mona Lisa which gets famous for many circumstances, mainly external
            reasons,
            this video only talks about the painting itself, not some special history or events that envelop the
            painting. Definitely check this video, if u still wondering why some paintings can get really famous, while
            all u can see is just a mediocre random picture.

            </a>

        <p class="text-justify">
            Ahhh good ol 'RWBY, I really can't talk anything related to RWBY in a short way, but for the sake of the
            theme, I'm gonna try to make it as short as possible and eliminate anything that unrelated to this
            particular video in a separate writing. Oh, yeah, btw this is the best trailer ever, period. Oh, and the
            best fighting with the best choreography too. Upon the first time witnessing it, I feel really really amazed
            by everything they try to offer, and at the same time, I already declared that it's the best in some
            categories. Sadly, when I show this to anyone, they don't seem to like it, so I thought it just me that has
            a <element class="popup-meme" onclick="togglePopupMessage(`(like hell it's gonna be the case lol)`)">
                low standard</element>, yea I know, perhaps they don't watch it
            to the fullest extend like, watching it in 144p, without sound, skipped it every 2 seconds, etc. or they
            simply watch it but didn't observe it, but nevertheless its a prove that this video cant be taken seriously
            cus perhaps its look so underwhelming, idk. But, after watching <element class="popup-meme"
                onclick="togglePopupMeme(`rwby-sucks.png`)">
                2.5 hours of essay video by hbomberguy</element> named
            <element class="popup-meme"
                onclick="togglePopupMessage(`(yea I know RWBY sucks, more than anyone, BUT ...)`)">
                'RWBY Is Disappointing, And Here's Why'</element> I gain my consciousness
            again by thinking that everyone is just stupid :p, Nah jk, I'm just that smart :v:v. He mentions that the
            RWBY trailer is <element class="popup-meme"
                onclick="togglePopupMessage(`(well he said it's no.2, but the first one is obviously a joke)`)">
                the best</element>, and talks about it briefly why he thinks like that, but sadly, he doesn't really
            touch the technical part except the music. So here's my opinion about it, why this Red Trailer is such an
            amazing trailer. I'm gonna start it with a breakdown of what I'm thinking the first time I watched it, and
            make a conclusion in the next paragraph. (But watch that trailer first so ur opinion isn't biased, and I
            suggest u watch it on 720p, use a headphone with 70% volume, and turn the CC on for maximum experience lol)
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            It starts with rather calming music with echoing <element class="popup-meme"
                onclick="togglePopupMessage(`(actually, I don't really understand sh*t about music, but I'm just gonna say what I know/feel)`)">
                voice sounds</element>, then we see that the animation use red and white (and
            black (and blue?)) contrast color on the objects, 'the art style is interesting' I said, the petal and snow
            moves beautifully and made it looks like it's popping out if viewed in a <element class="popup-meme"
                onclick="togglePopupMessage(`(lol I'm not the first one who noticed this)`)">
                good monitor</element>, oh and if u can notice, its 30 fps and 3D animations are usually 12 fps, so it's
            already made a good score here. Then u can see a person wearing a red hood, which immediately makes me think
            of The Red Riding Hood, 'i might be wrong but it's gonna be cool if the character is based on that' i say.
            She walks away from the gravestone with her head facing the bottom which means she's sad or mourning. She
            walked down past a dark forest, which if I'm being honest, is not an amazing or detailed animation but just
            great enough considering this is a video from 8 years ago from a small company. The music beat sounds deeper
            right after the animation transition shows us several <element class="popup-meme"
                onclick="togglePopupMessage(`(which make me instantly say 'yep, its The Red Riding Hood, are the situation is inverted now? 1 girl slay dozens of wolf?')`)">
                black wolves</element>, it really suited well
            with the lyric too, 'Black the beast descends from shadows', and after the beasts jump at her, she's using
            seemingly some kind of magic and jump on top of them, then the music leaves the vocal alone and said
            'gold..' while showing yellow ambient light of the moon, ahh <element class="popup-meme"
                onclick="togglePopupMeme(`perfection.gif`)">
                perfection</element>. After the short music drop, she
            shows her calm face, and the mechanical noise of the gun transforming fills the void, and after it's over,
            the upbeat music started again with a sign of the first headshot sound, ahh <element class="popup-meme"
                onclick="togglePopupMessage(`(I'm gonna stop saying this, otherwise I'm gonna say it over and over again until the end lol)`)">
                perfection</element>. And don't forget that cool
            shaking camera works and slow-motion tho. Then, the action starts. He shoots 3 bullets, and if u have a good
            eye u can instantly understand that she's using the shoot's recoil as a way to propel or stopping herself.
            That petal from splatting blood tho, ugh. Here u can see that that shotgun thing can transform into a
            scythe. She hit the wolf but unfortunately, the blade didn't slice him, but after smiling, which shows that
            it's under her control, she pulled the trigger again and uses the recoil as a way to slice that wolf. And we
            got this <element class="popup-meme" onclick="togglePopupMeme(`slowmo-rwby.png`)">
                majestic slow-mo wallpaper-able scene</element>. She sticks her scythe on the ground and starts shooting
            rapidly, this preventing the massive recoil from that weapon although we can see that she's still taken back
            a little bit with each shoot. And when there's 1 wolf that succeeds in getting close, she unplugs the weapon
            from the ground and shoots that wolf which makes her propelled a few meters too, this, really emphasis the
            massive recoil that gun has. Then after managed to stand on top of her weapon, which shows us that the
            weapon is completely <element class="popup-meme" onclick="togglePopupMessage(`(pun intended)`)">
                under</element> her control, we started to see an S+ tier melee choreography which
            I won't talk about part by part. As always, she's using the recoil, and because the weapon is heavy, not
            just looks heavy, she uses her swinging momentum as a way to move her weapon or herself to attack or even
            dodge. This makes the fighting style a thousand times better than any character from another movie, anime,
            games, or anything that used an oversized weapon. Usually, a big weapon like this is written (or act) to be
            like a 1 Kilogram thing that they can move around as they please, which doesn't really make sense and
            uncool. You can see here that there's no unnecessary closeup like the camera is on her fcking face and
            showing her arm moving around randomly and beating the enemy offscreen with no fcking reason why they show
            it that way OR unnecessary big explosion in each hit that leaves a meteor size crater on the ground or
            character that getting punched back and break dozens of building until it finally stops but no damage
            whatsoever OR some attack that has a big flashy light which indeed looks cool but really lack of substance,
            writes these down, anime choreographer! Ugh, there u go, whining about unrelated stuff again, so, back from
            sidetracking. After she's getting punched, and the music started to slow down, we can see that the enemies
            number are still around 30, and now with a serious face, she reloads the weapon but with a different logo on
            the magazine, a black circle which is pointed by 4 arrows from different locations. I don't know what this
            means when the first time watching it, but after watching the series, that logo means its gravity 'dust',
            that gunpowder means it makes the recoil even harder. After she shoots it in the opposite direction of the
            enemies, the weapon launched her at such a high velocity to the enemies. The blur and the screen that
            getting whiter and gradually clearer EACH time she pulled the trigger which means a sudden increase in
            acceleration and deceleration is freaking cool, and don't forget the speed up music that exactly the same
            from the beginning too. If u look at it correctly, you'll notice that she change the form of her weapon to
            <element class="popup-meme" onclick="togglePopupMeme(`rwby-style2.png`)">
                this</element>, this allows her to spin if she pulled the trigger again, as u can see in the video.
            After that, she
            basically just gliding and spinning while occasionally controlling her weapon. And now it's ok to do a
            close-up face scene because: first, we already know clearly what she's doing, how and why she moves that
            way. Second, it shows that she's doing attack a lot faster than <element class="popup-meme"
                onclick="togglePopupMessage(`(which means it already shows us some fighting scene beforehand, unlike most of the anime that take this route after the very first second the battle started)`)">
                BEFORE</element>, so if they animated it again, it's gonna be harder to differentiate which one is
            faster if all of the fights are always on a high tempo. Last but not least, this closeup scene only lasts
            not more than 2 seconds, while it still shows some zoom-out picture occasionally, which shows us what is
            she actually doing. Then the video ends with her posing, not too special but pretty cool with the raining of
            empty shells.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            So, there u go, a mysterious badass character based on a famous fairy tale that has magic power and a
            freaking badass weapon that can change to 4 different forms and have some special bullets. Not to mention
            the kick-ass music that syncs with the best choreography and a unique fighting style. Yeah, the graphic
            itself isn't the best but the color pallet is cool enough to keep me interested. 'I can't help but wonder
            what kind of epicness the series gonna deliver' I think.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            There's so much information being delivered in this short video but without spoiling any detail or huge
            plot, that's, what a good trailer is.

            Now I'm gonna talk about something that a little bit different. For those of u who don't believe in Islam or
            from another country beside Indonesia, perhaps u wanna skip this one. Ok, actually I don't know what
            category these videos are best in, moreover, these are not the video that I used to remember, IIRC it has
            more length and better in every aspect, but sadly I can't found it, and if these 2 videos are <element
                class="popup-meme"
                onclick="togglePopupMessage(`(I'm gonna mention these 2 videos as one entity from now on)`)">
                combined</element> it's gonna be the closest thing to a video that I
            used to remember. I can't say for sure that it's the best Islamic lectures or not, there are dozen out there
            that have a really good delivery, from a better message, diction, pacing, to a more entertaining,
            encouraging, eye-opening thing, etc.
            some of them are far exceeding this one. But one thing for sure, this video makes me 100% convinced of what
            I'm gonna answer when the interviewer asks who's my idol that isn't the prophet itself <element
                class="popup-meme"
                onclick="togglePopupMessage(`(I've been in this situation twice and I don't really know the answer lol)`)">
                lol</element>. But all jokes aside, yeah UAH (abbreviation
            from Ustadz Adi Hidayat) is the coolest guy that still alive, and this video gives u a glimpse of what he
            <element class="popup-meme"
                onclick="togglePopupMessage(`(there're a ton of things that I wanna talk about, but I think it won't be necessary for the theme)`)">
                capable of</element>. So, without
            further ado, here's my story. 1 or 2 years ago I've been really bothered by the question 'Where's the God?'
            because of <element class="popup-meme"
                onclick="togglePopupMessage(`(I don't think I should talk about it)`)">
                'something'</element>. So, I started to search for it on Youtube,
            and I've seen dozens of videos that talk about this topic, by different Ulama ofc, many big names from
            Indonesia including but not limited to, Ust. Abdul Somad, Ust. Khalid Basalamah, Ust. Firanda Andirja, Ust.
            Zulkifli M. Ali, Ust. Syafiq Riza Basalamah, Ust. Yazid bin Abdul Qadir Jawas, Aa Gym, Buya Yahya, Gus Baha,
            etc. You name it. I even stumble across some Malaysian Ustadz that I don't remember the name of, and the
            greatest man from India itself, Dr. Zakir Naik. But none of them really make me satisfied, some of the
            answers are really felt one-sided and not fully addressing the argument of the other, but what's worse, some
            of them are just too convoluted with no conclusion or even answer it with a joke. And when u look closely,
            there is a big number of people who <element class="popup-meme"
                onclick="togglePopupMessage(`(which means they disagree)`)">
                dislike the video</element> or peoples who explain their disagreement in the comments section of those
            videos. Until.. I found UAH's video, it gave me all the answers that I was looking for AND
            he is even adding some important messages that other many failed to address. It was really a pleasuring
            experience, to give you a better idea, imagine watching a series, from the first episode until the 23rd
            episode u haven't figured what's this show truly about, who's the bad or the good guy, what's the meaning of
            this and that, what's the reason by everyone's action, what's their motives, etc. every single episode only
            add more question than answer, and at the end of the series, when u feel like you're just going to drop it,
            u painfully watched the last episode, and to your surprise, the answer to every question u had in mind about
            the shows is finally beautifully revealed, the show's ending even told u something that hasn't even crossed
            your mind yet, and that, was my feeling when watching UAH's video. Now, I'm not gonna explain explicitly to
            u what I'm truly talking about, I don't wanna interpreted anything that's too dangerous to discuss. My best
            suggestion is u just need to go watch these 2 videos I already mentioned, u must watch both of em, or
            everything that I've talked about become doesn't really make sense. Or if wanna go far, just watch any
            videos that talk about this topic, but not from UAH, and after u watch, like, 10 of them, go watch these 2
            final videos as a closing, you'll feel the satisfaction just like me. And speaking of which, if u somehow
            watched these 2 videos and doesn't feel anything, or worse, u do exactly what he tell u not to do, like,
            denounce other ulama because u Think u have a good reason, or bloody worse, mocking any ulama just to make u
            feel like the coolest guy for (probably) making some guys laugh by having more sins or other nonsense
            reasons, Idk what people's motive on <element class="popup-meme"
                onclick="togglePopupMessage(`(If u do this then you're just unsalvageable lmao jk.. kinda :v)`)">
                this one</element>. And just a quick note, u should watch the first video carefully, because if u hear
            it while playing with ur phone, I can say for sure that u r gonna missed some big points, like some people
            does in
            the comments section (yeah the pacing is kinda bad and it isn't most coherent video out there, especially
            with some term that u may never hear before).

            Alright, so that is the end of the thread, originally I wanna put 7 titles here, but those 2(3) last titles
            are making me a little too carried away, but relax, I'll definitely continue this next time, and I hope u
            enjoy + not having a more negative opinion about me, lmao <element class="popup-meme"
                onclick="togglePopupMessage(`(actually, I do :( )`)">
                like I fcking care</element>. And like I said before if u have anything in mind just tell me in the
            comment section below. That's about it, see ya.
