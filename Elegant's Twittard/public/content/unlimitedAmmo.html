        <p class="text-justify">
            So I'm gonna answer Sugondase Man's question from a few days ago in <a href="../reqask.html"
                target="_blank">ReqAsk</a>. He says '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85MsgH2p-Fk"
                target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85MsgH2p-Fk</a> if u were to write that kinda scene,
            how would you justify the unlimited ammo? using magic/supranatural is ok but I wanna see u try to keep it as
            realistic as possible. please and thank you'. For those who don't know what the heck is 'Sugondase' means,
            <element class="popup-meme" onclick="togglePopupMessage(`(Sugondase nuts, haha got 'em)`)">
                click here</element>, and if u don't wanna waste your internet quota to watch that Youtube video,
            basically it's the scene in the Resident Evil: Vendetta where 2 characters shooting zombies with
            seemingly 'unlimited' ammo with a handgun and an assault rifle.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Ok, before I start to answer this question, I wanna apologize to Sugondese Nu.., I mean Sugondese Man, cus I
            said I'm gonna answer it soon, but in reality, it's more than <element class="popup-meme"
                onclick="togglePopupMessage(`(yea I know, 'soon' is relative, but if I'm not too lazy I can post this in approximately 2 hours tho)`)">
                1 week</element>. I've been 'kinda busy' lately, so I just can answer it now. Speaking of which, at
            first I thought I'm gonna be able to write these things once every 3 days, but in reality, I've <element
                class="popup-meme"
                onclick="togglePopupMessage(`(half of them are playing video games or watching random youtube videos lol)`)">
                many other things to do</element>, so yeah.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Ok, I'm gonna start answering his question, what would I do if I write that kind of scene, or in other
            words, does <element class="popup-meme" onclick="togglePopupMeme(`unlimited-blade.jpg`)">
                unlimited blade ..</element>, I mean, does unlimited ammo works?
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            When the story is set on a high fantasy world, a place that has their own sets of rules and physical laws,
            some fantasy weapons which not predefined how it works are very understandable and not some big of a deal.
            Although it's gonna be way better if you just at least add a few lines or seconds of screen times about how
            it works. Most of the time, this kind of information will not harm the flow of the storyline, even though
            sometimes is kinda useless, but still... You can choose to explain how the weapons work before the usage or
            after, it really depends on your story plot or your writing style, or u can just make it as a <element
                class="popup-meme" onclick="togglePopupMessage(`(search it for yourself :p)`)">
                MacGuffin</element> kind
            of weapon, but this, is an entirely different matter.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Say, in the Star Wars universe, u have a blaster that seemingly has unlimited ammo, and nobody bats an eye
            right? But in fact, this blaster is fueled by gas and energy cell. This energy cell contains hundreds if not
            thousands of laser bullets. So from the Star Wars example above u can take a conclusion that u can choose to
            explain the detail to give an extra layer for a hardcore fan to enjoy, or u can just sweep it under the
            carpet, given the fact that most of the viewer didn't notice or care about the ammo things. Whatever it's,
            it
            doesn't really matter, as long as u can just describe it like 'the ammo of this weapon is a highly
            compressed condensed durable crystal which capable of containing high energy blablabla', it's up to u. Or, u
            can just leave it as the way it's, in a fantasy world, peoples are just gonna assume that those weapons have
            some limitation or some sh*ts. You can just focus on other things when the viewer or the community will come
            to their own conclusion, thus, it's a safe option either. BUT, what I think the most important part of all
            thing, is consistency. You can make a weapon that harnesses the energy of the environment around it or make
            a weapon that consumes the user's lifespan or soul, it's up to u, it's fantasy godammit. But still, even
            though it's fantasy, u can't just write that this weapon only capable of doing a, and limited to b, but
            suddenly you make it capable of doing y and limited to z, without some freaking good explanations. This
            consistency thing isn't limited to the weapon only, some other things that came from a high fantasy world
            should have a rule that is implemented consistently, for example, <element class="popup-meme"
                onclick="togglePopupMessage(`(but the explanations, is something that yet to come)`)"> magic spells or
                on some part, power scaling</element>.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            But if the setting is low fantasy, a world that similar to our real world but with some twist (for examples,
            zombie apocalypse, alien invasion, <element class="popup-meme" onclick="togglePopupMeme(`hackerman.png`)">
                evil hackel man</element>, etc), u cant just make the others part (other than the
            obvious one) suddenly become like a high fantasy without a good reason. Similar to what we have seen from
            that Youtube video above, you can't just make the ordinary gun behave like it's from another world, u know,
            like hundreds of bullets in a single magazine. Actually, for the video above it's more complicated than
            this, we'll get into that later. So, in a low fantasy world, people have a general tendency to relate it to
            the real world on some levels. They will use what they know in real life as a part of the information on
            that story. One of the best examples is how the gun in these world works, people would just assume that it's
            similar to our ordinary everyday gun, like handguns are usually contained with <element class="popup-meme"
                onclick="togglePopupMeme(`handgun.png`)">
                this many ammo</element> and assault
            rifle contains <element class="popup-meme" onclick="togglePopupMeme(`assault-rifle.png`)">
                this many ammo</element>. So u must expect a huge backlash from the viewer if u write something that
            too deviated from what they believe. As u can clearly see in the comment section of that Youtube video,
            people would just complain or make fun of how ridiculous the weapons seem.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify font-weight-lighter">
            (btw take this one with a grain of salt, I'm not an expert... I mean I'm not an expert at anything, but just
            add
            a little bit of extra salt here lol)
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            But like I said above, it's complicated on that particular video, why? Because upon further inspection, its
            kinda make sense if u look closely. That assault rifle is out of the question, people seem to agree that
            it's not salvageable lol, it's just too far fetched, take a look at <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_D5GPZD9cQ" target="_blank">this</a> or
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gm_VfMUAEw" target="_blank">this</a>, u can tell that it's
            significantly different, people who defend this are just being too denial lol. But in Leon's handgun case?
            it's debatable, but my conclusion after researching about it a little bit, SIG-Sauer P226 E2 'Sentinel Nine'
            with 30 rounds does indeed can look <element class="popup-meme"
                onclick="togglePopupMeme(`leon-handgun.png`)">
                like this</element> if the real version of SIG-Sauer P226 with 20 rounds looks
            <element class="popup-meme" onclick="togglePopupMeme(`handgun20.png`)">
                like this</element> (perhaps made it a little longer and its perfect lol). Whatever the case, what this
            movie did here is sucks, not even the reload scene can save this bad
            thing, I mean, they can make it a lot better just with adding a tiny thing. They can make these two
            characters talk a little bit about their own gun specification or anything that shows us that these weapons
            are modified or some sh*ts, (or just make em reload faster, is it that hard -_-?) I think that's gonna make
            it look way better and reasonable. But without explaining it beforehand, I think they make at least 50% of
            viewers slightly (or very) annoyed. The only ones who didn't feel bothered at all are people who already
            know about this subject or a hardcore fan who loves these things no matter how ridiculous it seems or
            <element class="popup-meme"
                onclick="togglePopupMessage(`(but when I was a kid, I watch this and I feel annoyed, so :v)`)">
                a kid</element>, which is less than 10% lol (i guess?).
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            So that's pretty much my opinion on this matter, I hope it's clear enough (not too convoluted), and ofc, can
            answer Sugondese Man's question. Tell me what u guys think. That's about it, see ya.
