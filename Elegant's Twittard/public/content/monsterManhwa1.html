            Manhwa, or what people used to call <element class="popup-meme"
                onclick="togglePopupMessage(`(Which is kinda wrong. Webtoon is scrolled down format, instead of swiping left/right like a book)`)">
                webtoon</element>, is one of the misunderstood-est things (at least for me lol). Back then,
            I thought webtoon is just a bunch of romance or drama comics that I won't possibly touch, ever. But now,
            I open it, like, almost every day lol.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Ehem, so back to the topic, after reading <element class="popup-meme"
                onclick="togglePopupMeme(`rookie-number.jpg`)">80+ titles</element>, I found 4 manhwas that really stand
            out above the rest for some particular reasons, and what I mean by 'the rest' is the limit of what comics
            capable of itself. And those comics are :
        </p>
        <h5 class="text-justify font-weight-bold">
            1. Lookism
        </h5>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Let's start with one of the most famous webtoons in Indonesia, I really skeptical about this webtoon, u
            know, cus Indonesian peoples have sh*tty taste lol. The proof is, some of the best manhwas are at bottom of
            the list in the Indonesian version of Webtoon, but in the English version, those manhwas always staying at
            the top. What a loser. Umm, I'm just, gonna stop my ranting, this is not what I'm signed for.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Ok, so At first, I thought the story is about an ugly boy who suddenly transforms into a handsome man, and
            he gains a lot of popularity from girls or other boys (in a bad way). So we will see how he manages to hide
            the truth that he's actually an ugly and weak boy in everyday life, and at the end of the story, he will
            find someone who truly likes him as the way he is. The end. You know, like a classic romance story.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            But no, that's completely <element class="popup-meme" onclick="togglePopupMeme(`wrong.gif`)">wrong</element>
            , turns out, this webtoon is all about fighting. Frankly speaking, this webtoon is the most all-around
            manhwa I've ever read. It has a funny arc, sad arc, scary arc, etc., and an almost non-existence romance
            arc, fortunately. It's kinda funny to think that it's 180 degrees different from what I've thought before.
            I'm not gonna spoil anything here, but believe me, the percentage is like this 20% Fighting scene, 50% drama
            that surrounding those fighting scenes, and the rest is just an ordinary drama (which eventually evolves
            around fighting too lmao).
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            That's it? is that the reason why I call it a monster? just a bunch of 'fighting' words and I <element
                class="popup-meme" onclick="togglePopupMeme(`losing-his-mind.jpg`)">lose my mind</element>?
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            <del>Yes</del>
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Ofc not, don't be silly. Now let's talk about the fun part. Say, what's the boring or weakest part of comic
            format compared to video? Exactly, it's <element class="popup-meme"
                onclick="togglePopupMessage(`(ur answer is different? lol, tell me what it's in the comment section below)`)">
                the static image</element>. Now, how can u overcome this? how can a mere bunch of static pictures
            surpass the glorified animated video? Tbh, I don't know what the list of the actual answer is, but one thing
            I
            notice after reading this comic is u can do that by putting f*cking plot twist on every goddamn panel,
            literally.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            When an animated video tries to make a plot twist, it needs a good transition, build up, and momentum to
            deliver it perfectly. But within these static images, u can just do it however and whenever u want, and it
            would still look flawlessly. Moreover, the webtoon format(vertical scroll with a big image in each panel) is
            just perfect to execute this kind of thing, compared to manga which 1 page consists of several frames, which
            obviously not suitable for a twist, you will immediately get spoilered just by reading the top frames. The
            author of these <element class="popup-meme"
                onclick="togglePopupMessage(`(I include How to Fight (Viral Hit in the English version) and Loser Life)`)">
                comics</element> seems to know this trick and he really utilizes this benefit to its maximum capacity.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            You can or can't predict what r u gonna see on the next panel, but the end result would always be the same,
            you'll just gonna get shocked and impressed at the same time each time u scroll it.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            It's just 1 of a particular set of skills that this comic has, but that's what I really admire, so I didn't
            include many other godly perks he has. And therefore, that's why I call this manhwa, a Monster.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Previously I mentioned How to Fight and Loser Life, go check it out, it has the same author and the same
            writing style too. It's almost as good as Lookism, actually, to put it simply, it just Lookism with a
            smaller scale. Oh, and they share the same universe too.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            (Note: what I mean by plot twist doesn't necessarily mean like a big plot twist at the end of a movie, but
            sometimes it just a minor plot twist in a battle scene or just a twist moment in the drama scene, u should
            get my point. Oh, and if u think I'm exaggerating I dare u just give me 1 episode which doesn't have a
            twisting moment at all and I'll commit sudoku)
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            <span class="font-weight-bold">Final score:</span>
            <element class="popup-meme" onclick="togglePopupMeme(`twist.gif`)">
                plot twist</element><span class="font-weight-bold"> out of 10</span>.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            lmao, I didn't expect that it's gonna be this much just for talking about 1 manhwa. So, I'm just gonna call
            it a day for now and continue the second part later. (spoiler: it's gonna be a lot crazier than this,
            there's 1 manhwa that makes me wanna talk about this 'Monster' topic in the first place so..) Oh, and one
            last thing I wanna mention, in case u didn't know, u can read these manhwas on Line Webtoon for free, ok,
            see you later, bye.
